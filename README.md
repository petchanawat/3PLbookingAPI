# 3PLbookingAPI Project (Best Price for API Direct Booking with Third Party Logistics Project)
Old Pain Points
  - Information must be copied and pasted between Airtable (the operational database) and third-party logistics order management systems like Deliveree and Lalamove. There may be human mistake.
  - Before reviewing the total charge and booking, the location must be entered into third-party logistics order management systems.
  - It takes a long time to compare order fees between two third-party logistics providers since the logistics admins must do it one at a time.

New Solutions
  - Make an application that allows drivers to submit evidence of pickup and drop-off goods, including real-time times, to the operating database.
  - It takes no more than 2 minutes to complete the application loop.

I used Retool (backend workflow, graphic interface, and frontend software development).

This image is the first page of the mobile application for drivers.
