# 3PLbookingAPI Project (Best Price for API Direct Booking with Third Party Logistics Project)
Old Pain Points
  - Information must be copied and pasted between Airtable (the operational database) and third-party logistics order management systems like Deliveree and Lalamove. There may be human mistake.
  - Before reviewing the total charge and booking, the location must be entered into third-party logistics order management systems.
  - It takes a long time to compare order fees between two third-party logistics providers since the logistics admins must do it one at a time.

New Solutions
  - Design a web application for sending API direct requests to get delivery fees from responses and create delivery orders after knowing the price. Using information from Airtable (the operating database) directly. (Name, Telephone, Address, Latitude, and Longitude)
  - It takes no more than 5 minutes to complete the price check and shipment booking.
  - Have a choice to choose the best price because of getting a delivery fee from two third-party logistics companies forÂ doing it once.

I used Retool (backend workflow, graphic interface, and frontend software development).

This image shows the web application before retrieving data from the operating database, checking prices, and booking delivery orders.
